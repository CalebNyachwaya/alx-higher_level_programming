## 0x09. Python - Everything is object

In this project, we delve into the concept of objects in Python and explore how everything in Python is considered an object. We examine the properties and behavior of objects, and how they can be manipulated and interacted with using various built-in functions and operators.

### Topics

The project covers the following topics:

- Object-oriented programming
- Objects and classes
- Attributes and methods
- Object identity and type
- Object mutability and immutability
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Built-in functions and operators for working with objects

### Project Description

In this project, we have a set of questions and corresponding answer files that dive into the nature and behavior of objects in Python. The answer files contain detailed explanations and insights related to each question, providing a deeper understanding of the concept of objects in Python.

### Project Files

The project includes the following files:
