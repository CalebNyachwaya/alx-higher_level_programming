## 0x09. Python - Everything is object

*In this project, we delve into the concept of objects in Python and explore how everything in Python is considered an object. We examine the properties and behavior of objects, and how they can be manipulated and interacted with using various built-in functions and operators*
<br><br>

**Topics**
- Object-oriented programming
- Objects and classes
- Attributes and methods
- Object identity and type
- Object mutability and immutability
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Built-in functions and operators for working with objects
