## 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
*Reading and writing files are fundamental operations in programming used for tasks such as configuration files, data parsing, and data storage/retrieval. File methods, JSON encoder/decoder, and the with statement are essential concepts that provide flexibility, efficiency, and resource management in file operations, data serialization, and clean and error-free resource handling in modern programming.*
